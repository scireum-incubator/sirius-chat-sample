# SIRIUS Chat Sample

This is an illustration project used to showcase how to setup and use the
[SIRIUS](https://github.com/scireum/sirius-kernel) libraries.

The task at hands is creating a small web server which provides a chat room
for clients which are connected via web sockets. The task itself is split up
into challenges - some build up onto each other, others are more like side
quests which provide some functionality but can also be skipped.

Also feel free to have a look around, place breakpoints, figure out how
the surrounding framework works and most importantly **HAVE FUN** :smile:

## SIRIUS

SIRIUS is split up into distinct modules to provide a broad range of use-cases.
The modules are:
* [sirius-kernel](https://github.com/scireum/sirius-kernel) - Contains common code and especially the [dependency injector](https://github.com/scireum/sirius-kernel/tree/master/src/main/java/sirius/kernel/di)
* [sirius-web](https://github.com/scireum/sirius-web) - Contains the the web server along with [**Tagliatelle**](https://github.com/scireum/sirius-web/tree/master/src/main/java/sirius/tagliatelle) which is our template engine
* [sirius-db](https://github.com/scireum/sirius-db) - Contains a persistence framework which helps to manage [JDBC](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jdbc/) datasources, [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/), [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/index.html) or [Redis](https://redis.io/documentation)
* [sirius-biz](https://github.com/scireum/sirius-biz) - Contains a lot of high level frameworks which help to built cloud native business applications

## Pre-Requisites

You should have the following Software stack installed in order to execute these challenges:

* Java JDK 8 *recommended*- [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/install/) or [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) *registration needed*.
    * Alternative for some Windows systems uncapable of running Docker Desktop: [Docker ToolBox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/)
* [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Once everything is installed, launch IntelliJ and choose to create a New Project from Version Control, and give the official Github URL for this project:

https://github.com/scireum-incubator/sirius-chat-sample.git

> **_Note:_** A Popup will show up suggesting to Import as a Maven Project. Click **Import** and/or enable the Auto-Import option.

## Introduction

To save some time, the project is already setup and also contains some scaffolding for the
challenges. This project can be built using [**Apache Maven**](https://maven.apache.org/) and should be developed using
[**Jetbrains IntelliJ IDEA**](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).

To understand the inner workings first have a look at the [pom.xml](pom.xml) which tells
maven how to build this project. Then consult the [src/main/resources/application.conf](src/main/resources/application.conf)
and [develop.conf](develop.conf) to understand the configuration of the application itself
as well as the developer config which is used when starting the application locally.

(The system configuration is accessible via either [Sirius.getSettings()](https://github.com/scireum/sirius-kernel/blob/master/src/main/java/sirius/kernel/Sirius.java#L607)
or by using the [ConfigValue](https://github.com/scireum/sirius-kernel/blob/master/src/main/java/sirius/kernel/di/std/ConfigValue.java) annotation.
An example is the [WebServer](https://github.com/scireum/sirius-web/blob/master/src/main/java/sirius/web/http/WebServer.java#L82)
provided by **sirius-web**, which uses the configuration to determine which port to 
open etc.)

Speaking of which, SIRIUS applications can be started using a Java Application Run configuration as follows:
- Main Class: `sirius.kernel.Setup`
- VM Options:`-Ddebug=true -Dide=true`

> **_Note:_** one more very important file (**src/main/resources/component.marker**). Although this file
is empty, is it essential, as it is used by the [Classpath](https://github.com/scireum/sirius-kernel/blob/master/src/main/java/sirius/kernel/Classpath.java)
scanner of the [Dependency Injector](https://github.com/scireum/sirius-kernel/blob/master/src/main/java/sirius/kernel/di/Injector.java)
to discover all classpath roots which participate in the SIRIUS system.

## Challenges

Ok, we're almost good to go. Before diving into the first challenge, start a Debugger using the **Setup** run configuration to make sure that the base system is operational. This will start
a [**Docker**](https://docs.docker.com/) container for [**Redis**](https://redis.io/documentation) and one for [**Elasticsearch**](https://www.elastic.co/guide/index.html) which are required for later
challenges (the stack is configured in [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml)). Once a message
like `System is UP and RUNNING` appears in the console, you should be able to view the chat UI: http://localhost:9000
> **_Note:_** you can also have a look at the system state via http://localhost:9000/system/state and
even monitor some details via http://localhost:9000/system/console (e.g. by executing the `http` command). 

> **_Hint:_** Each challenge has a unique ID (such as CHALLENGE-1). You can search in all files ("Find in Path")
using this ID to spot all relevant code positions. You will also find the appropriate `Class.solution` file
which will assist in case you're in trouble :wink:

### Hello Myself (CHALLENGE-1)

The first step is to make the server respond to incoming chat messages. These messages will
simply be sent back to the client. But first, let's find out where the client comes from. Head
over to the [ChatClientController](src/main/java/client/ChatClientController.java) and read the
JavaDoc - then come back here. 

Now that we know how the client is delivered, we can start the challenge. The client connects via
a "web socket" which is more or less a persistent HTTP connection which exchanges messages (called)
frames. (You can review the client code required to open a web socket in JavaScript - but that's
not required for our challenge - [client.js](src/main/resources/assets/client/client.js)). For each
web socket being connected, the [WebSocketDispatcher](src/main/java/server/WebSocketDispatcher.java)
will detect this and initialize a [ChatSession](src/main/java/server/ChatSession.java). Head over
to the session class to read the provided docs and finally to start some coding! :computer:

![diagram](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scireum-incubator/sirius-chat-sample/master/diagrams/challenge-1.puml)

Once the challenge is completed, you should be able to chat with yourself. :clap:

### Hello Everyone (CHALLENGE-2)

For the second challenge, head to [ChatSessionRegistry](src/main/java/server/ChatSessionRegistry.java) and
implement the missing parts. Then switch to [ChatSession](src/main/java/server/ChatSession.java) and 
[ChatUplink](src/main/java/server/ChatUplink.java) to call the appropriate methods.

![diagram](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scireum-incubator/sirius-chat-sample/master/diagrams/challenge-2.puml)

Once this is all done, restart the debugger and open two or more tabs (or let others in the network connect to your computer).
You now have ONE server which can handle multiple users! :clap:

### Hello Neighbourhood (CHALLENGE-3)

The third challenge starts by extending [ChatUplink](src/main/java/server/ChatUplink.java) with [ChatClusterUplink](src/main/java/server/ChatClusterUplink.java) and
broadcasting the message to subscribers instead of sending it only to the local sessions registered.

The [ChatClusterUplink](src/main/java/server/ChatClusterUplink.java) is already prepared to publish the message to [**Redis**](https://redis.io/documentation),
but you will have to complete the code in order to forward to message the registered sessions.

The fun starts when you and other participants share the same Redis installation, which makes all computers
running the application as part of the same cluster.

We've configured Redis to expose port **16379** by default. Simply select one member to *share* his Redis container and
update the `redis.pools.system.host` in the [instance.conf](instance.conf).

> **_Hint:_** `ifconfig -a` on Mac/Unix or `ipconfig /ALL` on Windows are good commands to determine your IP address 
>(and as always, the good ol' [Google](google.com) for other ways)

![diagram](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scireum-incubator/sirius-chat-sample/master/diagrams/challenge-3.puml)

Now restart the application and MULTIPLE servers (with their own users) can now participate in the same chat! :clap:

### Ahoi World (CHALLENGE-4)

Now it is time to create a Docker image with our application.
In real life, apps do not run under IDEs :stuck_out_tongue:

Execute the Maven **package** Lifecycle, switch to the IntelliJ Terminal and execute the following command from the project's root folder:
 `docker build --rm -t sirius-chat .`
  
This command uses the provided [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) containing *instructions* to pack the compiled application inside an
image which can be executed stand-alone.

To launch your fresh created container, you can use this command: *switch localhost to your machine's IP address or another shared host if needed*
`docker run -d --name sirius-chat-container --rm -p 80:80 -e REDIS_HOST=CHANGE_ME -e REDIS_PORT=16379 -e ES_HOSTS=localhost:19200 sirius-chat`

After started, the application should be available at http://localhost. :clap:

To stop it, run `docker stop sirius-chat-container`

### Side-Quest: HA-Setup (SIDE-QUEST-1)

This challenge gives a small glance at how a high availability system looks like. The goal is to start 2 or more instances
of our chat app under a docker container, with a `traefik` container performing the load-balancing between them.

Read the Quick Start Guide at [traefik.io](https://docs.traefik.io/getting-started/quick-start/) and fill up the 
[docker-compose.yml](ha/docker-compose.yml) file in in order to setup a load-balancer for our chat.

To start the set, head to the ha folder and issue: `docker-compose up -d`
To start 2 instances of the sirius-chat you can use: `docker-compose up -d --scale sirius-chat-sample=2`

![diagram](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scireum-incubator/sirius-chat-sample/master/diagrams/side-challenge-1a.puml)
![diagram](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scireum-incubator/sirius-chat-sample/master/diagrams/side-challenge-1b.puml)

Now when browsing the application via http://localhost, you should be able to stop one of the containers on-the-fly
and still be able to chat as you will be automatically be sent to another running host! :v:

### Side-Quest: Chat-Bots (SIDE-QUEST-2)

To add chat bots, have a look at the [ChatBot](src/main/java/bots/ChatBot.java) interface and the two
examples ([HelpBot](src/main/java/bots/HelpBot.java), [CalcBot](src/main/java/bots/CalcBot.java)).

To invoke the chat bots, jump back to the [ChatSession](src/main/java/server/ChatSession.java) and
invoke the bots in "handleChatMessage" instead of directly forwarding the message (there is a descriptive comment
there already).

Once that works, make sure to have some fun by either modifying the existing bots or by providing your own.
Maybe add a command to report how many people are in the chat, or when user X wrote the last message 
(both would require to extend ChatSessionRegistry a bit). :v:

### Side-Quest: Rate-Limiting (SIDE-QUEST-3)

Now that our precious chat server is running, we need to protect it from the cruel outside world.
sirius-biz provides a simple but effective firewall which relies on redis to ensure some rate limiting
(e.g. user X doesn't perform action Y more often than 1000 times per 1 minute). The class is named
**Isenguard** and an example of using it can be found in the [ChatClientController](src/main/java/client/ChatClientController.java).

Two places are naturally interesting to rate limiting **ChatSession.handleChatMessage** to handle
the number of incoming chat message and **ChatSession.onWebsocketOpened** to handle the number of
connection attempts. Obtain a reference to Isenguard using a static field + @Part and enforce
a proper rate limit. Play around with the settings in application.conf (requires a restart) to
ensure that they work.

Note that [Isenguard](https://github.com/scireum/sirius-biz/blob/master/src/main/java/sirius/biz/isenguard/Isenguard.java)
provides a bunch of additional methods. You can use **Isenguard.isRateLimitReached** and its callbacks and notify everyone
that someone reached its limit. Or you can provide a custom ChatBot which reveals the current limit status
for the caller by using **Isenguard.getRateLimitInfo**.

### Side-Quest: Search (SIDE-QUEST-4) 

Searching and sorting is all that computers do :smile: Therefore we also want to provide a way to search
in the history of our chat room. Luckily, sirius-biz and sirius-db provide connectivity to all sorts
of databases (MariaDB, MongoDB, Elasticsearch). The latter is interesting for us, as it provides a
complete fulltext search engine out of the box. Have a look at [SearchableChatMessage](src/main/java/search/SearchableChatMessage.java)
which is the entity class (a Java class which defines the fields to be stored in Elastic). The
[SearchMessagesController](src/main/java/search/SearchMessagesController.java) is also readily available
and provides a tiny UI to search in elastic. Also have a look (and later play around) with the template
which is used to actually render the search output [search.html.pasta](src/main/resources/templates/search.html.pasta).

To ingest data into Elastic, jump to the [ChatSessionRegistry](src/main/java/server/ChatSessionRegistry.java) and
implement the TODOs in **distributeMessage**. After restarting the debugger, new chat message should be
visible in the search UI.
